Ideas:
	Define the person's job based on what actions they do in game/What skills they have
		- For example, give every player the ability to arrest someone that damages another player
		  Then based on if they arrest someone x amount of times, you'll be able to claim your job as a cop
	
	Add custom pick up sounds per resource
